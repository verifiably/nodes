# nodes — full-text search (derived index) design

- **Date:** 2026-06-22
- **Scope:** The full-text search piece of the substrate's derived index (spec
  §5). Python first; a TypeScript port follows in a later plan, at semantic
  parity.
- **Status:** Historical design — implemented in Python and TypeScript; the current contract is in `docs/STANDARD.md` §§9–11.

## 1. Motivation & goals

Substrate spec §5 calls for a rebuildable derived index backing fast CRUD/search,
listing **full-text search (ripgrep-class)** as one of its faces alongside the
already-built structural index (resolution + relation graph). This design builds
that search face.

"ripgrep-class" is read here as the *performance/role* bar (fast, rebuildable,
files-stay-canonical), not literal regex scanning. The query model is **tokenized
ranked search** with **BM25F** relevance scoring — what an application's search
box needs ("most relevant thoughts/entities for these words"), the first concrete
consumer being Mindful v6.

### Goals

- Rank nodes by relevance to a free-text query over their `title` and `body`.
- Weight `title` matches above `body` matches, with weighting that stays an
  explicit, tunable contract (not baked into a synthetic term-frequency trick).
- Pure-Python, in-memory, rebuildable from the canonical files — the same shape
  as the structural `Index`. No external dependencies beyond pydantic.
- Semantic Python↔TS parity, pinned by shared fixtures (a tokenizer oracle and a
  ranking oracle).

### Non-goals (deferred — YAGNI)

- Stemming / lemmatization (morphological matching). Parity-fragile; can come
  later behind the same tokenizer seam.
- Highlighted snippets / excerpts. Results return refs + score + matched terms;
  the caller hydrates the `Node` via `Corpus.get` when it wants text.
- Indexing facet values or frontmatter fields. Only `title` + `body` for v1.
- Regex / boolean / phrase query operators. Bag-of-terms only.
- On-disk persistence of the index (a separate later plan); built in memory.

## 2. Architecture & placement

A new derived index, sibling to the structural `Index`, in the **kernel** (spec
§2: the kernel owns the derived index).

- **New module `python/src/nodes/core/search.py`**, containing:
  - `tokenize(text: str) -> list[str]` — the canonical tokenizer (§3).
  - `SearchIndex` — the inverted index + BM25F scorer (§4–5).
  - `SearchHit` — the result dataclass (§6).
- **`Corpus` owns a `SearchIndex`** alongside its structural `Index`: built in
  `__init__` from `store.all_nodes()`, kept current in `add`/`delete`/`rename`,
  and queried via a new `Corpus.search(query, limit=None)` (§7).
- Python exposes the surface by module path (`from nodes.kernel.search import
  SearchIndex, SearchHit, tokenize`); the package barrels are empty today, so no
  barrel changes are needed.

Files stay canonical; the index is disposable cache, fully reconstructable by
`SearchIndex.build(store.all_nodes())`.

## 3. Tokenizer — the canonical contract (highest parity risk)

`tokenize(text)` is deterministic and identical across languages. Steps, in
order:

1. **NFC-normalize**, then lowercase.
   - Python: `unicodedata.normalize("NFC", text).lower()`
   - TS: `text.normalize("NFC").toLowerCase()`
   - Without NFC, visually identical composed vs decomposed Unicode (e.g. `é` as
     U+00E9 vs `e`+U+0301) would tokenize differently.
2. **Split into tokens** = maximal runs of Unicode alphanumeric characters
   (`\p{L} ∪ \p{N}`). Everything else (whitespace, punctuation, underscore,
   apostrophe, hyphen) is a separator.
   - TS: `s.match(/[\p{L}\p{N}]+/gu) ?? []`
   - Python: `re.findall(r"[^\W_]+", s)` — under stdlib `re`'s Unicode `\w`,
     `[^\W_]` is "word char excluding underscore", i.e. Unicode alphanumerics.
   - Consequences pinned by the oracle: `well-known` → `["well", "known"]`;
     `don't` → `["don", "t"]`; `state_of_art` → `["state", "of"(stop→drop),
     "art"]`; `R2D2` → `["r2d2"]`.
3. **Drop stop-words** — membership test against a fixed frozenset (§3.1).
4. Return the surviving tokens **in document order** (duplicates kept — term
   frequency is meaningful for documents). Query-side dedup happens in
   `search`, not here (§5).

Empty / whitespace / all-separator / all-stop-word input → `[]`.

### 3.1 Stop-word list (fixed, pinned)

A small fixed English list, defined as a module-level frozenset and frozen by the
oracle:

```
a an and are as at be but by for if in into is it no not of on or
such that the their then there these they this to was will with
```

(33 words.) Intentionally minimal; expansion is a later, oracle-gated change.

### 3.2 Tokenizer oracle (built first — see §9)

A committed `fixtures/search.tokenizer.json`: a list of `{input, tokens}` cases
that **both** languages must reproduce exactly. Required coverage: stop-words;
mixed case; punctuation; underscores; numbers; apostrophes; hyphens; composed
(NFC) vs decomposed (NFD) accents normalizing to the same tokens; empty string;
whitespace-only; mixed scripts (e.g. Latin + CJK + Cyrillic); and at least one
non-BMP alphanumeric token so the TS code-point comparator is exercised rather
than silently falling back to UTF-16 code-unit order.

## 4. Scoring — BM25F (field-weighted)

Two fields, `title` and `body`, combined the proper BM25F way: per-field
term-frequency contributions are length-normalized and summed into a single
weighted term frequency **before** saturation, with one IDF per term (not two
independent BM25 scores summed).

For query term `t` and document `d`:

- **IDF (non-negative, Lucene form):**
  `idf(t) = ln(1 + (N − df(t) + 0.5) / (df(t) + 0.5))`
  where `N` = number of documents and `df(t)` = number of documents containing
  `t` in `title` **or** `body`.
- **Weighted term frequency** over fields `f ∈ {title, body}`:
  `tf'(t,d) = Σ_f  boost_f · tf_f(t,d) / (1 − B + B · len_f(d) / avglen_f)`
  where `tf_f` is the count of `t` in field `f` of `d`, `len_f(d)` is `d`'s token
  count in field `f`, and `avglen_f` is the mean field length across all docs.
  If `avglen_f == 0` (no document has any token in that field), the field
  contributes 0 (its `tf_f` is necessarily 0) — guard the division.
- **Per-term score (standard BM25 numerator, with `(K1 + 1)`):**
  `score(t,d) = idf(t) · (K1 + 1) · tf'(t,d) / (K1 + tf'(t,d))`
- **Document score:** `Σ_t score(t,d)` over the **deduped** query terms that
  occur in `d`.

### 4.1 Constants (module-level, the tuning contract)

```
K1          = 1.5
B           = 0.75
TITLE_BOOST = 2.0
BODY_BOOST  = 1.0
```

### 4.2 Determinism (parity-critical)

Float accumulation order is fixed so both languages run the same operation
sequence:

- Query terms are reduced to a **deduplicated list sorted by Unicode code point
  order** before scoring. Python's default string sort already has this behavior;
  TS must use an explicit comparator over `Array.from(token)` code points rather
  than default UTF-16 code-unit sort.
- Per term, fields are combined in the fixed order `title` then `body`.
- The document score sums per-term scores in sorted-term order.

Even with an identical operation sequence, Python and JS `log`/libm can differ in
the last few ULPs, so scores are **not** asserted bit-identical. The parity
contract is the ranking oracle (§8): identical ranked `id` order, and scores equal
when rounded to 6 decimal places. Production ranking uses the same rounded score
key before the `id` tie-breaker, so two hits that are indistinguishable under the
oracle cannot flip order because of raw-float noise:

```
score_key(score) = floor(score * 1_000_000 + 0.5) / 1_000_000
sort key = (-score_key(score), id)
```

Scores are non-negative, so this half-up helper is sufficient and identical in
both languages. The fixed accumulation order keeps rounding stable; ties in
ranking are broken by `id`, never by raw float order.

## 5. `SearchIndex` — state & operations

State (all in memory):

- `postings: dict[str, dict[str, tuple[int, int]]]` — term → uid →
  `(title_tf, body_tf)`. `df(term) == len(postings[term])`.
- `lengths: dict[str, tuple[int, int]]` — uid → `(title_len, body_len)`.
- `id_by_uid: dict[str, str]` — uid → current `id`, so hits carry a ref without
  touching disk.
- Running totals for `N` and summed title/body lengths → `avglen_title`,
  `avglen_body` (recomputed from totals, O(1) per query).

Operations mirror the structural `Index`:

- `build(nodes) -> SearchIndex` (classmethod) — full construction. Like the
  structural `Index.build`, it **rejects a duplicate `uid`** in its input with
  `CollisionError` (from `nodes.kernel.errors`) — it does not silently let a later
  node's `upsert` overwrite an earlier one. (`build` is fed validated corpus
  snapshots, but failing early keeps it honest and matches the structural index.)
- `upsert(node)` — if `node.uid` is already present, remove its old postings and
  lengths first; then tokenize `title` and `body`, add per-field postings, record
  lengths, and set `id_by_uid[uid] = node.id`. Idempotent and update-safe.
- `remove(uid)` — drop the uid from `postings`, `lengths`, `id_by_uid`; decrement
  totals. Removing an absent uid is a no-op.
- `search(query, limit) -> list[SearchHit]` (§6).

A node whose `title` and `body` produce no tokens still occupies a document slot
(`lengths[uid] = (0, 0)`, no postings) so `N` and the averages stay correct.

## 6. Query API & result shape

```python
@dataclass
class SearchHit:
    id: str
    uid: str
    score: float
    matched_terms: list[str]   # sorted, deduped query terms present in this doc
```

`Corpus.search(query: str, limit: int | None = None) -> list[SearchHit]`:

1. `terms = sorted(set(tokenize(query)), key=unicode_codepoint_order)`. If empty
   → return `[]`. TS must use the same code-point comparator, not default
   UTF-16 sort.
2. Candidate docs = union of `postings[t]` over `t ∈ terms`. Score each (§4).
3. Sort by **(score_key descending, id ascending)**, where `score_key` is the
   6-decimal half-up rounded score from §4.2 — id breaks rounded-score ties for
   full determinism.
4. Truncate to `limit` (`None` = unbounded).
5. Each `SearchHit.matched_terms` = the subset of `terms` present in that doc,
   sorted by the same Unicode code-point order.

The caller fetches the `Node` via `Corpus.get(hit.id)` when it needs the text.

## 7. Corpus integration

`Corpus.__init__` builds **both** derived indexes from a single `all_nodes()`
scan, so they share one snapshot and the disk is read once:

```python
nodes = self.store.all_nodes()
self.index = Index.build(nodes)
self.search_index = SearchIndex.build(nodes)
```

For `add` and `delete`, mutation ordering mirrors the structural index — **the
disk write/delete succeeds first, then both derived indexes update together**, so
no derived-index change is observable if the disk operation raises:

- **`add`**: `validate → index.assert_addable → store.write_file →
  index.upsert(node) → search_index.upsert(node)`. The structural `assert_addable`
  is the single point that can reject; once `write_file` succeeds, both `upsert`s
  are pure in-memory dict updates that do not raise on valid nodes.
- **`delete`**: `store.delete_file → index.remove(uid) →
  search_index.remove(uid)`.

**`rename` is best-effort, not all-or-nothing** — and this is unchanged from the
existing kernel. Rename validates every write before any write (no *partial disk*
rename), then commits across multiple files: write the new file, delete the old,
`index.upsert` the renamed node, then for each referrer write the file and
`index.upsert`. A disk failure *during* that multi-file commit can already leave
the structural index partially updated relative to disk; the recovery is a rebuild
(`Corpus(root)`), which both indexes support by construction. The search index
adds exactly one in-memory step to this same sequence: after the structural
updates, `search_index.upsert(node)` for the renamed node — its `uid` is unchanged
and its `title`/`body` are untouched by rename, so only `id_by_uid` changes.
Referrers' searchable text and ids are unchanged by rename, so they need no
search-index update. This plan does **not** refactor rename's commit atomicity;
the search index simply tracks the structural index's existing consistency model.

`Corpus.search` delegates to `self.search_index.search`.

## 8. Cross-language ranking oracle

A committed fixture corpus with prose-rich bodies plus a ranking oracle:

- `fixtures/search-corpus/` — a small multi-node corpus in the on-disk
  `kind/slug.md` layout, with varied natural-language bodies (so term frequency
  and field length actually differ across docs).
- `fixtures/search.oracle.json` — a list of `{query, hits}` cases, where each hit
  is `{id, score}` with `score` rounded by `score_key` (§4.2), in ranked order.

Both languages: build a `SearchIndex` over the fixture corpus, run each query, and
assert the ranked `id` order and 6-dp scores equal the oracle. Mirrors the
existing `fixtures/corpus.rename.canonical.json` cross-language parity check.

## 9. Testing strategy

- **Tokenizer (Task 1, built first):** unit tests + the `search.tokenizer.json`
  oracle (§3.2). This is the highest parity-risk surface and every later oracle
  depends on it, so it lands before any scoring code.
- **BM25F scorer:** unit tests on small hand-computed corpora where IDF, field
  length norms, and the title boost are checked against worked-out numbers;
  include the `avglen_f == 0` guard and a single-term/single-doc baseline.
- **`SearchIndex` build/upsert/remove:** unit tests, including re-`upsert` of an
  existing uid (postings replaced, not duplicated), `remove` of an absent uid, and
  `build` rejecting a duplicate-`uid` input with `CollisionError`.
- **Rebuild-equivalence property:** an index mutated incrementally
  (`upsert`/`remove`) equals a fresh `build()` of the same final node set —
  mirrors `test_index_rebuild_equivalence.py`.
- **`Corpus.search` integration:** ranking correct after `add`/`delete`/`rename`;
  title boost observable; `limit` honored; rounded-score ties fall back to `id`.
- **Cross-language ranking oracle:** §8.

## 10. Error handling

- Zero matches → `[]` (never raises).
- `limit`: `None` = unbounded; otherwise must be an `int` with `limit > 0`. `0`,
  negative, or non-`int` → `ValueError`. (`bool` is rejected as non-int.)
- Empty / stop-word-only / non-tokenizing query → `[]`.
- `SearchIndex.build` raises `CollisionError` (existing kernel error) on a
  duplicate `uid` in its input, mirroring `Index.build`.
- No new error types. Beyond the `build` collision check, the search layer raises
  only `ValueError` for the `limit` contract; it never raises on corpus content at
  query time.

## 11. Resolved decisions

1. **Query model:** tokenized ranked search, not literal/regex scanning.
2. **Backend:** hand-rolled in-memory inverted index + BM25F; no external deps;
   rebuilt on `Corpus` construction (structural-index precedent).
3. **Fields:** `title` + `body`, title weighted via `TITLE_BOOST`; explicit BM25F
   field weighting, not a boosted-token-stream approximation.
4. **Tokenizer:** NFC → lowercase → Unicode-alphanumeric runs → drop fixed
   stop-words; no stemming. Pinned by an oracle built first.
5. **Scoring:** standard BM25 numerator `(K1 + 1)·tf'/(K1 + tf')`; non-negative
   Lucene IDF; deterministic accumulation order; ranking uses a shared 6-decimal
   half-up `score_key` before the `id` tie-break.
6. **Results:** ranked refs + score + matched terms; sort
   `(score_key desc, id asc)`; query terms and `matched_terms` use Unicode
   code-point ordering; caller hydrates nodes lazily.
7. **Mutation ordering:** `add`/`delete` are disk-first, then `index` and
   `search_index` together (all-or-nothing). `rename` stays best-effort, tracking
   the kernel's existing multi-file commit model; this plan does not refactor it.
8. **Parity:** asserted by two shared fixtures — a tokenizer oracle and a ranking
   oracle (ranked `id` order + 6-dp scores). Scores are not claimed bit-identical.

## 12. Deferred / open

- Stemming, snippets, facet/frontmatter indexing, phrase/boolean/regex operators,
  on-disk persistence — all later, behind the seams above.
- Stop-word list expansion and any constant retuning are oracle-gated changes
  (they move the fixtures, so parity stays enforced).
