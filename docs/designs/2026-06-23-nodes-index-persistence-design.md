# Nodes Index Persistence — Design

**Status:** approved design (Python first; TypeScript port is a later spec)
**Scope:** on-disk persistence of the three derived indexes (`Index`, `SearchIndex`,
`VectorIndex`) so that constructing a `Corpus` over an unchanged corpus skips the
full parse + re-index pass. Realizes §5 ("fast I/O via a rebuildable derived index").

---

## 1. Goal & non-goals

**Goal:** startup speed at scale. A `Corpus` over a large, unchanged corpus should
load a persisted snapshot and reconcile only what changed on disk, instead of
re-parsing and re-indexing every `*.md` file on every construction.

Files remain the single source of truth; the snapshot is a **disposable, private,
per-language cache**. It is never the authority — every load reconciles the snapshot
against the current files by content hash, so a stale or absent snapshot costs only
time, never correctness.

**Non-goals:**

- No auto-flush. No `close()` / context-manager lifecycle. Writing is explicit.
- No eviction of orphaned raw-vector cache files under `.nodes-index/vectors/`.
- No cross-language snapshot reads (Python never reads a TS snapshot or vice versa).
- No approximate nearest-neighbour; cosine stays exact brute-force.
- The TypeScript port is a separate later spec; this spec is Python-only.

---

## 2. Architecture

Keep the three index classes **pure data with no file I/O**. They gain only pure
`to_dict()` / `from_dict()` (serialization is not file I/O).

A new module `python/src/nodes/core/snapshot.py` owns everything on-disk:

- the snapshot file location and atomic write,
- the `version` / `lang` gate and the **integrity validation**,
- the `path → (sha256, uid)` **manifest**,
- the **file-walk** (read bytes once, hash, parse-on-demand) shared by full rebuild
  and reconcile,
- the **reconcile** algorithm.

`Corpus` owns an in-memory manifest kept in sync across every write path, and exposes
`flush_index()`.

### 2.1 File layout

One JSON file per language under the already-git-ignored `.nodes-index/`:

```
<root>/.nodes-index/snapshot.py.json     # Python
<root>/.nodes-index/snapshot.ts.json     # TypeScript (later spec)
<root>/.nodes-index/vectors/<ns>/<sha>.json   # existing raw-vector cache (unchanged)
```

Distinct filenames are how the private per-language caches coexist in one repo
without clobbering each other.

### 2.2 Snapshot document

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "lang": "py",
  "manifest": [
    {"path": "gene/PHF19.md", "sha256": "<64 hex>", "uid": "7b2c…"}
  ],
  "structural": { "entries": [ … ] },
  "search": { "postings": { … }, "lengths": { … }, "id_by_uid": { … } },
  "vectors": { "namespace": "fixture-v1", "dim": 4, "vectors": { … },
               "id_by_uid": { … }, "hash_by_uid": { … } }
}
```

- `version` equals the module constant `SNAPSHOT_SCHEMA_VERSION` (starts at `1`).
  Any mismatch makes the snapshot unusable (silent rebuild).
- `lang` is `"py"`. A snapshot whose `lang` differs is unusable.
- `manifest` paths are **root-relative POSIX** strings (portable if the repo moves).
- `vectors` is `null` when the writing corpus had no embedder.

---

## 3. The manifest

The manifest is the authoritative list of indexed files. Each entry pins one file by:

- `path` — root-relative POSIX path,
- `sha256` — hash of the file's **actual on-disk bytes**,
- `uid` — the uid the file's node produced.

**Invariant (byte-level product):** the manifest is *always* produced by a byte-level
file walk — both on reconcile and on full rebuild. The load path never hashes
`node_to_markdown(node)`; it hashes the bytes read from disk. This guarantees that the
next reconcile's "did this file change?" test compares like with like (YAML/formatting
normalization can make `node_to_markdown(parse(bytes)) != bytes`, which would otherwise
mark unchanged files as changed).

The in-memory manifest is updated on every write path so that `flush_index()` needs no
re-reads (a freshly written file's bytes are exactly `node_to_markdown(node)`, so the
write path may hash those bytes — equal to the on-disk bytes it just wrote):

- **add(node):** set `manifest[rel(node)] = (sha256(node_to_markdown(node)), node.uid)`.
- **delete(node_id):** remove the entry for that path.
- **rename(old, new):** set the renamed node's new entry; if the path moved
  (`old_path != new_path`) remove the old path's entry; **and re-hash every rewritten
  referrer** at its (unchanged) path — rename rewrites inbound referrers' files too, so
  their bytes and hashes change.

---

## 4. Load & reconcile

`Corpus.__init__` (no snapshot write ever):

```
snap = load_snapshot(snapshot_path, embedder_namespace)   # None if no file / unusable
if snap is None:
    full_rebuild()        # byte-walk: read+hash+parse every file, build all indexes
else:
    reconcile(snap)       # byte-walk: read+hash every file; parse only changed/added
```

`load_snapshot()` reads and validates **only the cache file**. It never parses corpus
files, so it cannot raise corpus errors. It returns `None` (→ silent full rebuild) when
the file is missing, is not valid JSON, has a mismatched `version`/`lang`, fails
integrity validation (§5), or — when an embedder is configured — has a missing or
mismatched `vectors` section (§6).

### 4.1 Reconcile algorithm

1. Deserialize the three sections into live `Index` / `SearchIndex` / `VectorIndex`
   objects (snapshot-time state). In no-embedder mode the `vectors` section is ignored
   without deserialization (§6).
2. Walk current `*.md` files; for each read bytes once and compute `sha256`. Diff
   against the manifest:
   - **unchanged** (path present, hash matches): keep the deserialized state; do not
     parse.
   - **changed** (path present, hash differs): drop the manifest's old uid from all
     indexes; parse the node from the already-read bytes; upsert.
   - **added** (path absent from manifest): parse from the read bytes; upsert.
   - **deleted** (manifest path absent on disk): drop its uid from all indexes.
3. Apply all **drops before upserts** (so a uid that moves files is handled cleanly).
   Reconcile enforces the **full `build()` collision contract**, not just
   `assert_addable`: `build()` first rejects a duplicate uid outright (`node.uid in
   by_uid → CollisionError`) and only then calls `assert_addable`. `assert_addable`
   alone does *not* reject an added/changed node whose uid duplicates an unchanged entry
   with the same `uid` *and* `id` — it would silently replace it. So, after the planned
   drops are applied, reconcile requires every changed/added parsed node's uid to be
   **absent** before insertion, and duplicate uids among the parsed upserts themselves
   raise `CollisionError` — matching `build()` exactly.
4. Rebuild the in-memory manifest from this walk (root-relative path, freshly computed
   hash, node uid), satisfying the §3 byte-level invariant.

**Error scoping (cache vs. corpus):** the silent fallback is strictly for snapshot-cache
unusability detected inside `load_snapshot()`. Any error raised while reading or parsing
corpus files, or from the index collision contract — during *either* `full_rebuild()` or
`reconcile()` — propagates unchanged. Cache problems silently rebuild; corpus problems
surface.

### 4.2 Cost

Unchanged files cost one read + one sha256 (no YAML parse, no pydantic `Node`
construction, no index extraction). Changed/added files are read exactly once: hashed,
then parsed from the in-memory bytes.

---

## 5. Integrity validation

`load_snapshot()` validates internal consistency before any entry is trusted. "Hashes
match" alone proves only that files are unchanged, not that the cached index state
corresponds to them — so:

- **Duplicate manifest uids** → unusable.
- **Structural bijection:** the set of manifest uids equals the set of `entries` uids
  (one entry per uid; no duplicates). Any uid in the structural section but not the
  manifest, or vice versa → unusable.
- **Search bijection:** `lengths` keys, `id_by_uid` keys, and the manifest uid set are
  all equal; and **every uid appearing in any postings bucket** is a member of that set
  (no stale posting uids, no missing `id_by_uid` rows). Any divergence among the search
  maps → unusable.
- **Vector section** (only when an embedder is configured, see §6): `vectors`,
  `id_by_uid`, and `hash_by_uid` keys are all equal and equal the manifest uid set;
  `namespace` equals the configured embedder's `cache_namespace`; `dim` is `int | null`,
  with `null` valid **only** when there are no stored vectors, and otherwise every stored
  vector has length exactly `dim`. Any violation → unusable.
- Malformed section shapes (missing keys, wrong types) → unusable.

All of these resolve to `load_snapshot()` returning `None` → silent full rebuild.

---

## 6. Embedder / vector rules

The snapshot is usable for incremental load **iff** `version` and `lang` match **and**:

- **No embedder configured:** the `vectors` section is irrelevant. It is **not
  deserialized or validated** — a corrupt `vectors` section does not force a rebuild.
  Structural + search load and reconcile normally.
- **Embedder configured:** the snapshot must carry a `vectors` section whose
  `namespace == embedder.cache_namespace` and whose `dim`/uid-set pass §5. Otherwise the
  whole snapshot is unusable → full rebuild. Rationale: rebuilding vectors needs every
  node's `embed_text`, which means parsing every file anyway, so a model/namespace change
  cleanly forces one full rebuild (a rare event; simplest correct path). During reconcile
  with a matching embedder, vector upserts/drops ride the same diff as structural/search,
  using the corpus's embedder + raw `VectorCache`.

---

## 7. Per-index serialization

Each index owns its `to_dict()` / `from_dict()`.

- **SearchIndex** — persist `postings` (`term → uid → [title_tf, body_tf]`), `lengths`
  (`uid → [title_len, body_len]`), `id_by_uid`. Recompute `_total_title` /
  `_total_body` by summing `lengths` on load (single source of truth; no stored-total
  drift).
- **VectorIndex** — persist `vectors` (uid → normalized vector), `id_by_uid`,
  `hash_by_uid`, `dim` (`int | null`; `null` only for an embedder-backed corpus with no
  stored vectors yet, mirroring the live `VectorIndex.dim`), `namespace` (`str | null`).
  Avoids re-reading N raw-cache files and re-normalizing on every startup. The three uid
  maps stay equal (§5).
- **Index (structural)** — persist per entry `{uid, id, kind, deprecated_ids,
  relations, membership_refs}` (the inputs `_extract_out_refs` consumes). On load,
  rebuild `id_to_uid`, `deprecated_to_uid`, `out_refs`, and `in_refs` by **replaying the
  same extraction**.

  **Parity-critical invariant:** the source and target `OutRef`s of one relation must
  share a single `Relation` instance, because `in_refs` dedup keys on `id(relation)`.
  Serialize each relation once per entry and replay extraction on load; never serialize
  the two `OutRef`s independently (that would create two `Relation` objects and break
  inbound/dangling dedup).

---

## 8. Corpus API

- `Corpus.flush_index() -> None` (new): serialize the three live indexes + the current
  in-memory manifest into the snapshot document and write it atomically (`<path>.tmp`
  then `os.replace`, the established pattern). Pure with respect to reads; raises on I/O
  failure (explicit — atomic write means no partial snapshot). When the corpus has no
  embedder, the `vectors` section is written as `null`.
- `Corpus.__init__` gains the load/reconcile behaviour of §4. It still **never writes the
  snapshot**. (The raw `VectorCache` may still write under `.nodes-index/vectors/` during
  `VectorIndex.build`, as today — hence "never writes *the snapshot*".)

---

## 9. Error handling summary

- **Silent → full rebuild** (cache problem, never a correctness risk; every load
  reconciles against current file hashes): snapshot file missing; not valid JSON;
  `version`/`lang` mismatch; integrity failure (§5); embedder-configured vector
  mismatch (§6).
- **Propagates** (corpus problem, not a cache problem): file read errors; frontmatter /
  `ValidationError` on a parsed node; `CollisionError` from the collision contract during
  rebuild or reconcile; `flush_index()` write/I/O errors.

This is the single deliberate exception to the project's "avoid silent fallbacks" rule,
justified by the disposable-cache contract (the same philosophy as the raw `VectorCache`,
whose deletion merely forces re-embedding).

---

## 10. Testing

- **Round-trip equivalence:** build → `flush_index()` → new `Corpus` (loads snapshot) →
  assert every query API (`resolve`, `outbound` / `inbound` / `dangling`, `search`,
  `similar`) is identical to a fresh full-rebuild corpus. Extends the existing
  `test_index_rebuild_equivalence.py` pattern.
- **Reconcile against on-disk mutation:** flush, then mutate files directly on disk —
  add a file, edit a file (content change), edit a file (uid change), delete a file —
  construct a new `Corpus`, assert results equal a from-scratch rebuild and the
  rewritten manifest is correct.
- **rename manifest:** after a `rename()` that moves a node and rewrites referrers,
  `flush_index()` + reload yields results equal to a fresh rebuild (guards §3's referrer
  re-hash and old-path removal).
- **Invalidation → silent rebuild, correct results:** corrupt/truncated JSON; wrong
  `version`; wrong `lang`; embedder-configured vector-namespace mismatch; vector
  dim mismatch.
- **No-embedder tolerance:** a corrupt `vectors` section does not prevent a no-embedder
  `Corpus` from loading structural + search (§6).
- **Error propagation:** a malformed corpus file raises on construction (not swallowed);
  a reconcile that introduces a uid collision raises `CollisionError`.
- **Full collision contract on reconcile:** a changed/added file whose uid duplicates an
  unchanged entry with the *same `uid` and `id`* raises `CollisionError` (not a silent
  replace); and two parsed upserts sharing a uid raise `CollisionError` — matching
  `build()`, not merely `assert_addable` (§4.1).
- **Empty embedder corpus:** a corpus with an embedder but zero nodes (`dim = null`,
  empty uid maps) round-trips through `flush_index()` + reload, and adding the first node
  afterward establishes `dim` correctly.
- **Relation identity:** inbound / dangling dedup is correct after a load (guards §7's
  shared-`Relation` invariant).
- **Integrity guards:** each → silent rebuild — a manifest uid missing from a required
  section; an extra index uid absent from the manifest; duplicate manifest uids; a search
  postings bucket naming a uid absent from `lengths`/`id_by_uid`; mismatched search maps;
  a vector `dim`/`namespace`/uid-map violation (§5).
- All existing parity tests and frozen fixtures continue to pass unchanged.

## 11. Module / file map

- **Create:** `python/src/nodes/core/snapshot.py` — `SNAPSHOT_SCHEMA_VERSION`,
  the manifest type, `load_snapshot()`, the file-walk, `reconcile()`/`full_rebuild()`
  helpers, atomic write.
- **Modify:** `python/src/nodes/core/index.py`, `search.py`, `similarity.py` — add
  `to_dict()` / `from_dict()`; expose the extraction replay needed by structural
  `from_dict`.
- **Modify:** `python/src/nodes/core/corpus.py` — load/reconcile in `__init__`,
  `flush_index()`, in-memory manifest maintenance across `add` / `delete` / `rename`.
- **Docs:** extend `docs/STANDARD.md` with an index-persistence subsection.
