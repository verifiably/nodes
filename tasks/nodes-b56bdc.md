Adopt the landed ops pre-push isolation block before the existing gate. Preserve keepalive, gate selection, custom steps, exact ref stdin and exit codes; Git LFS runs before isolation with its original environment and refs. Verify the exact hook with the shared behavioral regression, then project test-fast and required checks. Record the adoption commit on ops-e6ec4e.
