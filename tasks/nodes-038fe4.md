Rate every open scoped task in this project — status todo, doing, or blocked; ideas are rated when they are scoped, not before — plus any recurring task (`tasks list --periodic`), with the rubric in the tasks skill: low = approach established, relevant context identified, correctness has a clear check; mid = bounded investigation or implementation choices remain, scope and acceptance criteria clear; high = substantial discovery, subtle reasoning about interacting behaviour, or an unresolved architectural call. Read each task body, its notes, and any linked spec or plan first, and rate the judgment that remains after that preparation — not the size: a large mechanical change is low, a one-line subtle fix can be high. `tasks list --status todo --status doing --status blocked` lists the set; `tasks edit <id> --complexity <level>` sets each. Done when `tasks ready --max-complexity high` reports no "unassessed hidden" warning. Rated high itself because rating is judgment work reserved for a frontier session (tasks docs/specs/2026-09-12-task-complexity-design.md §3.3); it must not be picked under a cutoff.

## Notes

- 2026-09-12T16:43:48Z (main): Rated the three unassessed open tasks (9f6f50 low, 77c7cc mid, 32d86e mid) with reasoning in each task's notes; no periodic tasks; tasks ready --max-complexity high reports no unassessed hidden
